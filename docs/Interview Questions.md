### **Python for Data Analysis & Modeling**

1. **Describe a time you used Python to analyze loan or financial data. What libraries did you use and why?**
2. **Which Python libraries would you use to build and validate an econometric model?**
3. **How would you estimate prepayment risk or default probability using Python?**
4. **What’s your approach to cleaning and validating large datasets in Python before analysis?**

---

### **Plotting & Visualization**

5. **Which libraries do you use for data visualization in Python, and how would you use them to show trends in mortgage prepayments?**
6. **Demonstrate how you would visualize MSR valuation changes over time with matplotlib or seaborn.**

---

### **Statistics & Sensitivity Analysis**

7. **How would you use Python to run a Monte Carlo simulation to assess MSR risk?**
8. **Explain how you'd use Python to test the sensitivity of MSR valuations to interest rate changes.**

---

### **Integration with SQL**

9. **Describe a workflow where you extract data from a SQL database and perform valuation modeling in Python.**
10. **How do you handle large SQL query results in Python (e.g., memory management, batching, streaming)?**

---

### **Performance & Automation**

11. **What techniques do you use to improve the performance of Python scripts that process millions of loan records?**
12. **Have you built any automation in Python to generate recurring reports or analytics for financial instruments?**

---

### **Advanced/Optional**

13. **Have you ever implemented or used time series models (e.g., ARIMA, VAR) in Python for financial forecasting?**
14. **How would you use Python to interact with external valuation services or APIs for pricing validation?**
15. **Describe how you’d modularize and document your valuation models in a production-grade Python project.**
