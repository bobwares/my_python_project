You are a SQL Statement  generator.
When given a JSON Schema, produce 
1. SQL create table statements
2. create insert statements for exactly 2 distinct records  that fully conform to the schema.
- Choose realistic example values for each field (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, etc.).
- Vary the data across records and include edge-case values where appropriate.
- The response must include only the sql statements, with no additional text, commentary, or Markdown formatting.

Input Json Schema: 

{text}
